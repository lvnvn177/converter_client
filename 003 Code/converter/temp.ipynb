Introduction\\nDental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a well-\\nknown imaging modality for implant site imaging, maxillofacial\\ndiagnosis, orthodontics, and treatment planning in craniofacial\\nsurgery. Despite being a secure and reliable diagnostic method,\\nCBCT suffers from high-density objects such as metal implants and\\ndental ﬁllings. Such metal objects cause strong beam hardening\\neffects that signi ﬁcantly alter the energy spectrum of a beam,\\nresulting in prominent streak-like artifacts and shadows in CBCTimages that reduce the contrast, obscure the structure, and impair\\nthe detection of areas of interest. Therefore, the degradation of\\nCBCT image quality makes diagnosis challenging and time-\\nconsuming.\\nMetal artifact reduction (MAR) techniques for CBCT have been\\nwidely studied [ 1e15]. One approach involves mathematical\\ncorrection-based algorithms, which enhance the reconstructed\\nimage by reducing beam-hardening artifacts and correcting theerror model. Hsieh et al. proposed a polynomial error model with\\ncertain assumptions [ 16]. The error model was approximated with\\na relatively simple form, reducing the computational complexity of\\nthe estimation process. They demonstrated that two iterations are\\ngenerally suf ﬁcient to deal with a wide range of densities. Park et al.\\nproposed a beam-hardening corrector that accurately re ﬂected the\\ncharacteristics of beam hardening [ 17]. They demonstrated the\\ncorrector's performance using numerical simulations and phantom\\nexperiments. However, in the presence of several high-density\\nmetals, the metal regions in the sinogram are severely corrupted,*Please cite this article as: Jin Hur et al.
